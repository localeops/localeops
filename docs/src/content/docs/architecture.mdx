## Core Workflow

```
main branch update
      │
      ├──▶ localeops extract (snapshot + diff)
      │
      ├──▶ send to translator / AI
      │
      ├──▶ receive translated output
      │
      ├──▶ localeops apply (update locale files and locale snapshot)
      │
      └──▶ PR with updated translations
```

## Core Commands


LocaleOps provides three primary commands that work together:

### `localeops sync`

Creates initial snapshots for all configured target locales 
м
- Reads translation files for target locales
- Finds respecting values in source locale files
- Creates locale snapshots with those values


### `localeops extract`

Analyzes your locale files and creates a translation delta:

For each configured target locale:

- Makes source locale files snapshot
- Compares source locale snapshot to latest target locale snapshot
- Detects new strings that need translation
- Identifies modified strings that require re-translation
- Outputs structured JSON containing the translation delta

The output JSON can be sent to your translation provider (AI, agency, or human translators).

### `localeops apply`

Takes completed translations and integrates them back into your codebase:

- Reads translation JSON from your provider
- Updates locale files with new translations
- Creates a new snapshot of the current state
- Creates a pull request with changes

## Design Principles

### Provider Agnostic

LocaleOps outputs standard JSON. You control what happens next:

- Send to a translation agency API
- Process with an LLM (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- Convert to CSV/Excel for human translators
- Pipe through your own transformation logic
- Store in any format your workflow requires

Because LocaleOps is open source and format-agnostic, you can customize how translations flow through your stack.

### No Infrastructure Required

LocaleOps runs as a CLI tool in CI/CI - no servers, databases, or services needed:

- Runs in CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Uses Git for snapshot storage
- No external dependencies beyond your translation provider
- Scales with your repository, not separate infrastructure

## Workflow Patterns

LocaleOps supports multiple workflow patterns depending on your needs:

### Synchronous (Fully Automated)

Complete the entire translation cycle in one CI job:

1. Run `localeops extract` when source locale changes
2. Send JSON to AI translation service
3. Receive translations immediately
4. Run `localeops apply` to create PR

**Best for:** Fully automated pipelines with AI translation

### Asynchronous (Human-in-the-Loop)

Split extraction and application across separate workflows:

1. Run `localeops extract` in CI on source changes
2. Send JSON to external service, API, or human translators
3. Wait for translations (minutes, hours, or days)
4. Trigger second workflow when translations are ready
5. Run `localeops apply` to create PR

**Best for:** Human review cycles, agency workflows, or batch processing

## Extensibility

LocaleOps is built with extensibility in mind through abstract base classes:

### Framework Support

Extend `BaseFramework` to add support for new i18n libraries:

- **Built-in:** i18next, FormatJS
- **Custom:** Implement `deserialize()`, `serialize()`, `diff()`, `patch()`, `resolve()` methods

Each framework adapter handles its specific file format and translation structure.

### Storage Adapters

Extend `BaseDatabase` for custom snapshot storage:

- **Built-in:** File-based storage (Git-friendly)
- **Custom:** Implement `get()`, `set()`, and `initialize()` methods
- **Examples:** PostgreSQL, Redis, S3, or any key-value store

### Source Control

Extend `BaseSource` for different Git workflows:

- **Built-in:** GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket integration

The base classes provide a clean abstraction layer, making LocaleOps adaptable to your specific stack and workflow requirements.
