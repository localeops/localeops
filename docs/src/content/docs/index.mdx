description: Git-native translation workflow automation for i18n projects
---

LocaleOps prevents wasted translation work by tracking what changed in your source language and detecting when existing translations become stale - all while keeping your strings in Git instead of a vendor's database.

**The problem:** When developers change source strings (e.g., "Submit Form" → "Submit Your Application"), existing translations become wrong, but most tools don't detect this. Teams waste money re-translating or ship incorrect translations.

**The solution:** LocaleOps snapshots your source language after each translation, then diffs against it to detect exactly what changed. No vendor lock-in, no external database - everything stays in Git.

## Key Features

- **Git-Native**: Translations stay in your repository under version control
- **Framework Support**: Works with i18next, FormatJS, and custom parsers
- **Provider Agnostic**: Use any translation service (AI, human, or agency)
- **Change Detection**: Automatically detects new and modified strings
- **CI/CD Ready**: Runs entirely in GitHub Actions or any CI pipeline
- **Pull Request Automation**: Creates PRs for translation updates
- **Extensible Architecture**: Built on base classes for custom frameworks, storage, and workflows

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @localeops/localeops
```

### Configuration

Create a `localeops.yml` file in your project root:

```yaml
framework:
  name: i18next
  locale: en
  directory: ./locales

database:
  adapter:
    name: file

source:
  name: github
  base: main
  repo: your-org/your-repo
  token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}

locales:
  - es
  - fr
```

### Basic Usage

Extract new and changed strings:

```bash
localeops extract
```

Apply completed translations:

```bash
localeops apply <translations-json>
```

Make initial snapshots for all configured target locales:

```bash
localeops sync
```

### Automation

For automated workflows, check out the [GitHub Actions examples](/examples/github-actions).

For complete configuration options, see the [localeops.yml reference](https://github.com/localeops/localeops/blob/main/localeops.yml).
